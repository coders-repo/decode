Consistently interpret common log patterns such as log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, ERROR) and categorize each entry accordingly.\n3. Summarize each log entry by describing:\n   - The exact timestamp.\n   - The user responsible for the event (if available).\n   - The unique key or session token.\n   - The policy number (if present).\n   - Any error codes, warnings, or anomalies.\n4. If the log entry contains errors or warnings, highlight them and provide additional insights about potential causes or actions needed.\n5. When answering questions about the logs, ensure consistency and accuracy based on the provided log data. If a similar question has been asked before, provide a consistent answer.
